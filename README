This is a modification of hdlmake utility build by Pawel Szostek
and Tomasz Wlostowski.

The inteded modification is to allow ISE Simulation (ISim) simulation.

Original project in: http://www.ohwr.org/projects/hdl-make

=======================================================================

Installation Instructions (Ubuntu Linux):

	-> Change to a desired top directory. I will refer to it by
		<hdlmake2_parent_dir>

1 - cd <hdlmake2_parent_dir>

	-> Clone this repository.

2 - git clone git://github.com/lerwys/hdl-make2.git
or
2 - git clone https://github.com/lerwys/hdl-make2.git

	-> Put hdlmake2 tool in the system search path.
		Option 1: Make a symlink to hdlmake2 tool (recommended)
		Option 2: Copy hdlmake2 tool into a directory searched by
			your terminal emulator (bash, cygwin, etc)

3 - (Option 1) sudo ln -s <hdlmake2_parent_dir>/hdl-make2/hdlmake2 \
				/usr/bin/hdlmake2
or
3 - (Option 2) sudo cp <hdlmake2_parent_dir>/hdl-make2/hdlmake2 /usr/bin/

=======================================================================

Use Instructions:

For further instructions on how to use hdlmake2 refer to the documents
located inside the "doc" folder. You will find information regarding
what is the Manifests files, how to create them and how to create 
makefiles for simulation and synthesis.

The folder consists of two files files:

1 - hdlmake-manual.pdf: General instruction on how to create projects
based on hdlmake2 (or hdlmake, as they are mostly the same except for the
addtional isim support).

2 - hdlmake_quick_start.pdf: Quick start on how to create manifests file
and how to call and pass arguments to on hdlmake2 (or hdlmake, as they
are mostly the same except for the addtional isim support).

The files are best suitable for complementary reading, in spite of what 
the name generally means... =]

=======================================================================

Modifications:

The main modification this project introducesto the original hdlmake
was concerning the simulation makefile. Now, there is two simulator tools
supported by hdlmake2: vsim (Modelsim simulator) and isim (xilinx simulator). 
They can be specified as follows (remember that the directory where the 
hdlmake will be called must have a top Manifest file):

  -> Create a makfile targeting isim (Xilinx simulator tool)
  
$ hdlmake2 --make-isim

  -> Create a makefile targeting vsim (Modelsim simulator tool)
  
$ hdlmake2 --make-vsim

The other hdlmake options are left unmodified and can be specified for
hdlmake2 in the same manner as the original hdlmake.
